This is a simple command-line quiz that asks 5 questions about JavaScript values, data types, and operations.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v10+)
- The project already lists `readline-sync` as a dependency in the top-level `package.json`.

2. Run the quiz script:

   node practice-readline-sync-madhavilatha-y/values-data-types-quiz.js
